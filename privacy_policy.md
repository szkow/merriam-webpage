# Privacy policy

The only information this extension collects from the user is
any text entered into the dictionary search bar. When looking
up a word via higlighting it on the page, no information is
stored beyond the lifetime of the query to Merriam-Webster.

The collected information is not transferred or stored
outside of the user's local computer. It is only collected
for the purposes of maintaining a "search history" in the
extension's dropdown.

The collected information is not shared with any other
parties.
