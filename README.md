# Merriam's Webpage

A simple word look-up extension for Firefox and Chrome. When highlighting a word, just click the book that pops up to get the definition from Merriam-Webster's dictionary, or, look up words yourself using the button on your toolbar.

## Usage

The main use of this extension is looking up words found on web pages. When highlighting a single word on a page, a small book icon should pop up next to it. Clicking this will create a small window with the definition of the highlighted word. You can click and drag to move this definition around the screen if needed. Clicking anywhere else on the page will close the window. Note that on some sites, the book icon's location isn't always consistent (and on some pages the book doesn't show up at all!). In this case, you can right click with a word highlighted and select the "Look up word" option in the context menu.

On Firefox, Merriam's Webpage should already appear as a button (Chrome seems to hide these buttons by default). Clicking this will open a popup where you can look up words. Below the searchbar in this popup will appear your search history.
